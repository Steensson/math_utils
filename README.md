Sheldon's favorite number:
> The best number is 73. Why? 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying 7 and 3.

We get it, 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers!

> Chuck Norris wishes. In binary 73 is a palindrome, 1001001, which backwards is 1001001. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc!

```python
digit_sum(73)
> 1
```
